Carson Daly returns as host for Season 22.\n \nThe show's innovative format features four stages of competition: Blind Auditions, Battle Rounds, Knockouts and Live Performance Shows. This season's Battle Advisors include Charlie Puth (Team Camila), Jazmine Sullivan (Team Legend), Jimmie Allen (Team Blake) and Sean Paul (Team Gwen). For the first time ever, the third phase of the competition will include three-way knockouts.\n \nIn the Live Performance Shows, the top artists will compete against each other weekly during a live broadcast, and the television audience will vote to save their favorite artists. In the end, one artist will be named \"The Voice\" and receive the grand prize of a recording contract.\n\nAnd the Winner of The Voice Is... | NBC's The Voice Live Finale 2022\nhttps://youtu.be/wrKBOmnl3Ko\n\nThe Voice\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice",
